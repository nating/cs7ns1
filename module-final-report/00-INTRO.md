## InfernoBall team self-evaluation

- Team number: 18
- Team members: - Abhishek Jain, James Farrell, John Lincoln, Geoffrey Natin

All team members made good contributions. After initial group contact through email, we communicated through WhatsApp. For the most part, all team members were contributing to the conversation every day from the day that our InfernoBall was delivered until the day that it was finished. Communication was round the clock, from very early in the morning to very late at night. My phone was constantly buzzing with updates on hashes cracked for almost two weeks.

Some members were better at finding and narrowing down our wordlists, some members were better at running cracking constantly with almost instant turnovers with attack methods. In my opinion, each member of the team put in an admirable effort and was effective with the work that they did. As group projects go, this one went down extremely smooth. I believe myself lucky to have been paired with the three students that I was, and I think that each of them deserves a good grade for the effort that they put into this project.
