## Module evaluation

### What I liked

* It was interesting to get some experience of the world of hash cracking.
* It was good that practical assignment requirements were well documented and defined so that they could be graded with automated tests.

### What I disliked

* I did not like that students were made to do assignments they were told would be graded but were subsequently not.
* I did not like that students who had the ability to pay more money for processing power could achieve higher marks if they spent more money, as this would cause other students to get lower marks. This seemed unjust to me.
* I did not like how the module seemed to differ greatly from the descriptor students had signed up for.
* I did not like how there were so few lecture slides.
